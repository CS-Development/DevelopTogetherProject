# Step 1: Implement the barebone of the User Interface Layer

- Integrate the Login View Controller and the Signup View Controller storyboaryboard scenes, with a segue in between.
  [Main.storyboard](FilesToAdd/Main.storyboard)

- Integrate the LoginViewController class and the SignupViewController class

  [LoginViewController](FilesToAdd/LoginViewController.swift)

  [SignupViewController](FilesToAdd/SignupViewController.swift)

The two classes ATM just connect the UI Elements and their actions to the code, without functionality implementation.
We will implement the functionalities with a MVVM Architecture and following TDD.
