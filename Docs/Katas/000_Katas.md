# Katas

In order to practice and test the concepts we aim to use in our modular architeecture, we'll regularly organize Katas, possibly online and live, to make our proof of concepts (PoC).

Where possible, the Katas will be recorded and shared, otherwise we'll provide the sample code, the documentation and the relative tutorials.
