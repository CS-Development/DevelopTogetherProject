# Introduction

The aim of this project is to lean and train ourself to create a codebase with the following characteristics:

- complex
- reusable
- testable



For this reason we'll follow:

- [Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)](001_BDD.md)
- [Test Driven Development (TDD)](002_TDD.md)



We'll apply concepts and principles like as:

- [clean code principles](003_CleanCode.md)
- [S.O.L.I.D. code principles](004_Solid.md)
- [design patterns](005_DesignPatterns.md)
- [modular architecture](006_ModularArchitecture.md)
