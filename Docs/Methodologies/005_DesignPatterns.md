# Design patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They’re templates designed to help you write code that’s easy to understand and reuse. They also help you create loosely coupled code so that you can change or replace components in your code without too much hassle.



## Classification of patterns

All patterns can be categorized by their *intent*, or purpose. The three main groups of patterns are:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
