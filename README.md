  First goal of the project is to create a modular architecture with which is possible to create different kinds of apps in a easy and composable way. To achieve this goal, we need to identify the features and the modules of this architecture. Being flexible there will be three kind of module categories/layers: 

  - [core modules](Docs/Modules/000_CoreModules.md)
  - [common modules](Docs/Modules/001_CommonModules.md)
